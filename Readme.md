Slack app for Voting on Stories and Tickets remotely and asynchronously.

AsyncVoter allows an entire Slack team to vote on an issue. AsyncVoter keeps track of the votes and keeps them secret until you're ready to reveal the results. This means the your team does not have to be on Slack at the same time. They can vote asynchronously.

You can vote on any thing: you just provide some text to display. (You can include a line, for example, to a project task.)

## Usage

1. Install this app to your Slack team visiting http://asyncvoter.tk and pressing on the `Add to Slack` button.
2. Run a voting session on an issue launching the new `/voter issue` command in any channel.
3. Submit your vote pressing on any of the three difficulty buttons (Easy, Medium or Hard).
4. Finish and reveal the result of the voting session by pressing on the `Reveal` button. (We recommend to wait until you will receive 3 or more votes)

## Known Issues

- Votes cannot be reset. But users can vote multiple times on the same issue.
- It supports parallel voting sessions in different channels only.
