# Slack app for Voting on Stories and Tickets remotely and asynchronously.

AsyncVoter allows an entire Slack team to vote on an issue. AsyncVoter keeps track of the votes and keeps them secret until you're ready to reveal the results. This means the your team does not have to be on Slack at the same time. They can vote asynchronously.

You can vote on any thing: you just provide some text to display. (You can include a line, for example, to a project task.)


# Zsuark experimental

This is an experimental branch by Raphael Krausz - but feel free to join me.

## Currently implementing unit tests - mongo

 - next to ensure all other unit tests are present
 - Then integration tests
 - as soon as the first unit tests in, we can put this to staging, and start this branch as the new development branch 


## Usage

1. Install this app to your Slack team visiting http://asyncvoter.tk and pressing on the `Add to Slack` button.
2. Run a voting session on an issue launching the new `/voter issue` command in any channel.
3. Submit your vote pressing on any of the three difficulty buttons (Easy, Medium or Hard).
4. Finish and reveal the result of the voting session by pressing on the `Reveal` button. (We recommend to wait until you will receive 3 or more votes)

## Known Issues

- Votes cannot be reset. But users can vote multiple times on the same issue.
- It supports parallel voting sessions in different channels only.

You **need** to set up your own Slack **team** and Slack **app** to continue!

Try to understand the new features ES2015 brings, especially the new functional programming enhancements, such as:

- reduce
- filter
- promises

See the link in the references for a great walkthrough of this topic.

A [development guide](./DEVELOPING.md "Development Guide") is included as [DEVELOPING.md](./DEVELOPING.md "Development Guide") in this repo. This document should give you a roadmap to the software architecture and development.

##Â Setting Up your own Slack team and app

- [Create a Slack Team](https://slack.com/create)
- [Create a Slack app](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)
- Install `ngrok` and run `ngrok http 4390` to expose your local server
- Enable `Slash Commands` in your Slack app with `https://<YOUR-NGROK-URL>/commands`
- Enable `Interactive Messages` in your Slack app with `https://<YOUR-NGROK-URL>/actions`
